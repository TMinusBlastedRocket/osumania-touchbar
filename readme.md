BetterTouchTool config to use your touchbar in osu!mania Requirements: A Macbook Pro with touchbar (almost any of the post-2016 MBPs) *OR a Mac running macOS Catalina and an iPad docked in sidecar, osu!lazer and https://folivora.ai/ (bettertouchtool)
Thats it!

to use: select presets>import preset and import the file, it should automatically lock onto osu!lazer when launched

Be sure to have the default keybinds for lazer set or this will not work

warning: unlike https://github.com/TMinusBlastedRocket/osutaiko-touchbar, BTT does not work very well with mania
